This script let you can use CTRL-P/N to complete word in cmdline mode
 just like in insert mode.

for instance :
            1.   :something<C-P>
            2.   /else<C-N>
      
you also can map other keys instead of <C-P/N> like this in your vimrc: 
            cmap <C-J> <Plug>CmdlineCompletionBackward
            cmap <C-K> <Plug>CmdlineCompletionForward
